Hi All,

Finally, the minutes from our last meeting.

For those who have missed the last meet-up, the slides are [here](https://lazymindz.github.io/nottsai-workshop-nov62018/index.slides.html#/).

We have had a fantastic group of CTOs, Enthusiasts, Entrepreneurs, Practitioners turn up and discuss their vision, and answering &lsquo;Why I attend this Meetup&rsquo;.

Below is a short summary on the answers:

- Find ways AI can help turn their ideas into action
- Learn
- Interesting Talks
- Identify areas that we as a group can collectively work on and make an impact

There was an agreement that we should all propose ideas that are worth pursuing as a group.  

Here are the steps discussed:

- Each member to propose an Idea they think AI can solve and help our community (Nottingham/UK/World)
- Send out a poll to rate top ideas
- Choose one (or a few) and plan the next Meetups around them

We are the very beginning of the Cycle, and the next Meetup would be about developing the vision on the top proposals (Stage 1), and start identifying next steps on Data.

BTW when I say AI, all jargon applied.

Here&rsquo;s the timeline:

- This week and next week think about your proposal. 
- You can drop your idea on Slack, Meetup.
- End of Next week &ndash; Collate ideas and send out a poll that members can vote on
- End of November (Next Meetup)

Also, before we close, there are two Challenges too from this week&rsquo;s meetup (refer to the slides). Give them a try. Remember it&rsquo;s not the challenge that is important but the journey.

For members who are not on Slack, here is the [invite](https://join.slack.com/t/nottsai/shared_invite/enQtMzcxODg1OTA2NTEzLTkzZjFkNDViMDczYmU2NmIyMmM0MjZkNDc1NTMyNzk5MjhhODNlNDk1YzJiYTVmYzYyYWM3OTdlNzBmNmFmMTY)

Looking forward to your involvement and proposals. Reach-out to me if you need more information on any aspects.

Thanks.

Regards,

Siva
